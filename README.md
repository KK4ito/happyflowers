# happy flowers

happy flowers is an IP5 project at the [University of Applied Sciences](http://www.fhnw.ch/homepage) in Brugg-Windisch. It was conducted over the course of the fall semester 2016 by @RadLikeWhoa and @Rinesch with assistance by @danielkroeni.

The final product is an automatic watering system for household flowers using a Raspberry Pi, a Haskell back end, and a React front end.
